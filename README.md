# UPSminer-prototype
2013 PhD RA project. Emerson asked FAU data science lab to help them mine their battery database and predict faults. I wrote this windows forms GUI. Displays the SQL database, Builds queries to trim, clean, process, and display data on a graph. Graph is from my StockPlot program. (Not in a functional state, removed DB access for public)
